### Links

- Live Site URL:(https://ebunski-lorem-ipsum.netlify.app/)

### Built with

- React javascript
- CSS custom properties and dynamically rendered css classes
- Flexbox and grid

## My process

- I went through the mobile and desktop styles on the css files
- Created the layout of the components
- Gave the page life with the magic of javascript.

### What I learnt

1. React:

UseRef hook - used to get DOM nodes - useEffect and input (also for javascript styles)
Ensuring input is of correct data type and format (e.g parseInt)
used slice array method

Overall it was a very wonderful project.
